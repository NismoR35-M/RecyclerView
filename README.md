## SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences allows you to save key-value pairs to a device,that you can retrieve later.
Best suitable for saving small sets of data in the app quickly.Behind the scenes, SharedPreferences writes key-value pairs to a single file. You can
configure it to write to multiple files for more complex apps. You can also allow other
apps to access your appsâ€™ SharedPreferences store if you think other apps have a
valid reason to access your data.

## ViewModels
With view models,data is kept separate from the Activity.This comes in handy if the activity ever had to 
recreate itself,the data still exists somewhere and can be reused by the activity.
